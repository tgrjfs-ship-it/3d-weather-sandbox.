# 3d-weather-sandbox
this is a very complex project that simulates volumetric clouds with precipitation. i made a mobile friendly version of protomanly's weather. this might cpu, gpu and ram heavy because the complex 3d scenes requires strong hardware to render.

Minimum requirements for this simulation:
CPU: Mediatek Helio G85 or Snapdragon 665
GPU: Mali G52 or Adreno 610
RAM: 3GB or above

if your device hardware doesn't meet the requirements, this causes huge lag and crashes
